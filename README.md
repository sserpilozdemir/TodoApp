This mini-project is generated with pure javascript.

I learned lots of javascript fundamentals in this project that one of this is event listeners.

I faced a problem with my browser when I try to open with live server this project. An error is filter that I defined the filter with const. I found a solution at Stackoverflow and i defined again the filter with var. Then yes I ran successfully my mini project in my browser ! :)

You can watch all steps of this project in Udemy, from Mustafa Murat Coskun.
